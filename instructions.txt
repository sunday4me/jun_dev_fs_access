Backend (NestJS):

1. gRPC Server for FX Quote:
   - Set up a basic gRPC server using `grpc-js` or another library.
   - Provide a service method to fetch FX quotes or generate random quotes.

2. API Endpoint for FX Conversion:
   - Create a RESTful API endpoint in NestJS to handle currency conversion.
   - Define a route that accepts source currency, destination currency, and amount.

3. Endpoint Protection with API Key:
   - Implement middleware to check for the presence of an API key in the request headers.
   - Generate an API key for clients to use when making requests to the conversion endpoint.

4. MongoDB Integration:
   - Store each conversion request in MongoDB, including information like source currency, destination currency, amount, timestamp, etc.

Frontend (Next.js):

1. User Interface:
   - Design a simple UI with Next.js allowing users to input source and destination currencies and the amount to convert.
   - Display the converted amount and FX quote retrieved from the backend.

2. HTTP Client:
   - Use `axios` to make HTTP requests from the Next.js frontend to the NestJS backend.

3. API Key Authentication:
   - Include a mechanism in the frontend to prompt users to enter their API key.
   - Pass the API key in the request headers when calling the currency conversion endpoint.

4. Error Handling:
   - Implement error handling in the frontend to notify users of authentication failures or API errors.
   - Handle validation errors gracefully, providing clear feedback to users.

 Overall:

1. Documentation:
   - Document the process for obtaining and using the API key.
   - Provide clear instructions for setting up and running both frontend and backend applications.

2. Testing:
   - Encourage writing basic unit tests for critical components such as API endpoints and database interactions.
   - Focus on simple test cases to ensure functionality and catch common errors.

3. Code Review:
   - Conduct regular code reviews to ensure adherence to best practices and security considerations.
